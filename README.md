## Description

This was a basic project to get a handle on CRUD functionality before moving into actual database systems (MySQL, MongoDB, etc).  The focus for the project was mostly on figuring out how to do routing, handling data storage with a simple json file read/write scheme instead of anything more robust.  The app allows you to create, save, and delete notes.

## Installation

Assuming you have Node.js installed, you can download the source files and run it locally using 'npm install' followed by 'node server.js'.  Otherwise, check out the deployed app on Heroku.

## Usage

Clicking the start button will take you to the main page for the app.  From there you can enter information for the note.  The save icon in the corner will become active once there's content in the note, at which point you can click it to save the note.  Clicking the pencil icon will make a new note.  And of course the trash icons delete the notes.
